        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
